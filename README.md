## Introduction

**AgentBay** is a cloud sandbox service from Alibaba Cloud WuYing, providing isolated computing environments (Linux, Windows, Browser, etc.) that enable AI Agents to safely execute code, manipulate files, automate browsers, and perform complex tasks.
For detailed information and usage instructions about AgentBay, please refer to the official website: https://www.aliyun.com/product/agentbay

**Why This Plugin:**

Traditional AI Agents are limited to text-based interactions and cannot execute actual computational tasks. This plugin integrates AgentBay to give your Dify applications "real action capabilities":

- üîß **Code Execution**: Run Python, Shell scripts in isolated environments for data analysis, file conversion, etc.
- üåê **Browser Automation**: Automate web browsing, form filling, data scraping, and web operations
- üìÅ **File Operations**: Read/write cloud files, process documents and logs
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Automation**: Control Windows applications for RPA workflows
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Based**: All operations run in the cloud with security isolation, no local environment needed

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Data Analysis Agent: Run Python scripts to analyze user-uploaded data
- Web Scraping Agent: Automatically visit websites to extract information
- Automated Testing Agent: Execute web application automated tests
- Document Processing Agent: Batch convert and process file formats
- RPA Office Agent: Automate repetitive desktop operations

## Tools Reference

### session_create
Create a new cloud environment session. Supports 5 environment types: `linux_latest` (default), `browser_latest` (browser), `code_latest` (development), `windows_latest` (Windows), `mobile_latest` (mobile). Returns session_id for subsequent operations.

### session_list
List all active sessions created by this plugin under the current account, including session ID, environment type, etc.

### session_delete
Delete specified session and release cloud resources. Recommended to clean up promptly after operations.

### command_execute
Execute Shell commands in a session with support for custom working directory and timeout. Suitable for command-line operations in Linux/Windows environments.

### code_execute
Run code in a session, supporting Python and other programming languages. Can specify working directory, suitable for data processing, automation scripts, etc.

### file_operations
Unified file operation tool, specify operation type via `action` parameter:
- **read**: Read file content
- **write**: Write to file (automatically creates non-existent files)
- **list**: List directory contents

### browser_automation
Full-featured browser automation tool, requires `browser_latest` environment. Supports multiple operations via `action` parameter:
- **navigate**: Visit web pages
- **click/type**: Interact with page elements (locate using CSS selectors)
- **scroll**: Page scrolling
- **screenshot**: Capture page screenshots (supports full page or viewport)
- **get_content**: Get page HTML content
